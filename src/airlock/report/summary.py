"""Step-summary reporter (task 2.9, `ARCHITECTURE.md` 6.6).

Markdown for `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`: the counts, the skip accounting, every HIGH finding and the
evidence under each one. Every HIGH is listed because this is the output a reviewer actually
reads, and B8 is the failure it prevents: a flood of WARNs must not push a HIGH out of sight, so
WARNs are counted here and never enumerated.

Evidence and paths are attacker-controlled text (B11). Evidence only ever appears inside a fenced
block whose fence is longer than the longest backtick run anywhere in the rendered text, which is
what stops ``` inside a filename or a line of code from closing the block and handing the rest of
the summary to markdown. Everything outside a fence is flattened and has its markup characters
escaped, so a file called `**Deploy** [x](https://…)` renders as that string and nothing else.
