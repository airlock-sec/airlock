"""GitHub annotation reporter (task 2.9, `ARCHITECTURE.md` 6.6).

Emits `::error`, `::warning` and `::notice` workflow commands. Properties (`file`, `line`,
`title`) go through `escape_property`, which handles `%`, CR, LF, `:` and `,`; the message body
goes through `escape_data`, which handles `%`, CR and LF. Both orders matter: `%` is escaped
first, or a later substitution would inject a `%` that itself gets escaped again.

Why HIGH leads and why there are caps at all (B8): GitHub keeps only the first ten annotations of
each level from a single step; the rest are discarded, and the discarded ones never appear in the
check run at all (`ARCHITECTURE.md` 6.6, task 0.9). So the reporter chooses the survivors rather
than leaving it to the runner, and it leaves a slot for the note that names what was withheld: a
cap that spends the whole budget on findings hides the fact that anything was cut. Findings already
arrive in report order, so the first `high_cap` annotations are the first HIGHs.

Nothing is dropped quietly: when a cap bites, one more annotation of that severity says how many
went unlisted, so a flood of WARNs cannot make a HIGH look absent and a capped HIGH list cannot
look complete. INFO gets `::notice` for the same reason; the alternative was to hide it in CI.
