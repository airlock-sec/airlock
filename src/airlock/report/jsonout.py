"""JSON reporter (task 2.9, `ARCHITECTURE.md` 6.6).

The whole `ScanReport`, including every suppressed finding with the reason that hid it, so a
consumer can diff one run against the next without reading a log. Keys are sorted and severities
are written as labels rather than ints, because the bytes have to be stable for a golden test and
readable for a human holding the file.

`evidence` stays a string or null: it is attacker-controlled text, and it is the one field a
consumer must not render as markup.
