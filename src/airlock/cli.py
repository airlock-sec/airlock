"""Argument parsing, command dispatch and exit codes. Task 2.10 (`ARCHITECTURE.md` 8).

`scan` is the whole pipeline in one place, in the order the design fixes: startup checks, trusted
base, rule data, collection, engine pass and detectors, numbering, suppression, reporters. The
CLI is the only module that knows that sequence, which is why it lives here rather than in a
`pipeline.py` the layout does not list (project_structure.md 3).

Exit codes: 0 nothing at or above `fail_on`; 1 something is; 2 configuration or usage error;
3 internal error. Anything nonzero fails the job, and nothing here returns 0 on a path where the
scan did not complete, so a green run always means a scan actually ran.

Two rules the rest of the design depends on:

- The tool never fetches and never reads policy from the tree under review except in `full` mode.
  `--mode` and `--event` decide which of the three trust models apply, and an event name that is
  not one of the four mapped ones is a usage error rather than a guess.
- Rule data ships with the tool, not with the repository being scanned (B1). `--rules-dir` and
  `--roles` point at the copy that came from the pinned Action, and a scanned repository cannot
  add, edit or delete a rule by doing anything to its own files.

`manifest add` writes the manifest from the file it is given: one command per artifact, and the
result parses with the same loader the scan reads it with. `--dry-run` prints the same text in
place of writing it, so a CI job can advise a maintainer without touching the protected file
(task 3.12). `manifest check` runs the same pipeline as a scan and keeps the artifact findings,
because "is my manifest right" is the wasm_manifest detector's question and reimplementing it
here would be a second answer to it.
