# Publish the Wave issue batch (task 1.14) from docs/wave/issues/.
#
# Dry run by default: it prints the title, the label list and the resolved body length for each
# file, and changes nothing. `--apply` is the only mode that calls gh, and it refuses to start if
# the repository has no `Stellar Wave` label yet, because on an unapproved repository Drips strips
# that label silently and the issue would look published while scoring nothing.
#
# Issues are created in filename order so that the `#N` references inside a blocking banner resolve
# against the numbers that already exist. `{{issue:slug}}` becomes that number; `{{issue:self}}`
# becomes the issue's own number, which is only knowable after creation, so it is patched with
# `gh issue edit` immediately afterwards.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/create_wave_issues.sh                 # dry run against airlock-sec/airlock
#   sh scripts/create_wave_issues.sh --apply [--repo owner/name]
#
# AGENTS.md section 4: no network during a scan. This is not a scan; it is a maintenance script and
# it only ever talks to GitHub when given --apply.
