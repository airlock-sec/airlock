# Roadmap gate (task 1.9): every pull request that changes files must change ROADMAP.md too.
#
# Two checks, both stated in AGENTS.md section 1:
#   1. if the diff touches any file, it must touch ROADMAP.md;
#   2. the `Last updated` line must actually have moved, because a PR that ticks nothing and
#      rewrites nothing leaves the document claiming a state it no longer describes.
#
# Usage: scripts/check_roadmap_touched.sh <base-ref>
# In a workflow the base ref is origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF. A branch with no commits ahead of its
# base passes: there is no change to describe.
