"""Synthetic rule fixtures and the harness that scans them (`ARCHITECTURE.md` 12, task 2.12).

Each rule names its fixture builder in its own data file (`tests = { positive = ..., negative =
... }`), so the suite can ask every shipped rule for both halves and fail when one is missing
(`PRD.md` FR-13). Trigger text is assembled from fragments at test time and handed to the runner
as an in-memory tree, so this repository never commits a live-looking payload
(`project_structure.md` 6).

The caps here are smaller than the shipped policy defaults on purpose: a fixture should be long
because the rule says so, not because it is the size of a real minified bundle.
