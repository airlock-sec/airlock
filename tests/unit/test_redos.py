"""ReDoS timing harness (task 2.12, `PRD.md` FR-14 and 6.x, `ARCHITECTURE.md` 12).

The scanner's protection is structural: a line past `line_cap` never reaches a regex
(`rules.apply_patterns`), and the over-cap line is accounted for by `cfg-long-line` instead. This
module proves both halves, on inputs built to make a pattern work as hard as it can.

- Every pattern the scanner runs against attacker-controlled text is measured on cap-length
  adversarial lines: long runs of one character, unbalanced brackets, and the pattern's own literal
  fragments repeated, truncated and left dangling as a near miss.
- The 5 MB single-line file from `PRD.md` FR-14 is timed through the engine, where the length check
  is all that runs.
- A canary pattern that backtracks catastrophically is asserted to breach the same budget, so a
  green run means the bound bites rather than that it is too loose to notice.

Budgets are multiples of what the shipped patterns measure here: the worst cap-length line is
about 10 ms for the rule data and about 20 ms for `config_role`'s dangerous-command test against a
line of repeated `[a-z]`, so the per-line bound below is roughly three times the slowest real cost
while still being thousands of times smaller than what a backtracking pattern needs.
