"""The `builtin_patterns` rules (task 3.6, `ARCHITECTURE.md` 9.6).

The fixture gate proves each rule fires on its own positive case and not on its negative. What this
module adds is the reason the family exists: coverage outside the five config filenames, claimed by
the `roles` a rule names rather than enforced in detector code, and one Appendix B case carried all
the way to an exit code.

`PRD.md` Appendix B case 7 is a decode-and-eval line under `vendor/`. The old script missed it
because its `SKIP_DIRS` matched the prefix. Airlock opens the file, resolves it to role `source`,
and until this family existed no pattern rule read `source`, so the scan reported clean with the
same exit code as a repository holding nothing. Case 7 is therefore tested here through `run_scan`,
where the exit code is decided, rather than against a detector call.
