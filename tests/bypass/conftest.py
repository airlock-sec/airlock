"""Shared setup for the Appendix B regressions (task 3.9, `PRD.md` Appendix B).

The seven shapes are `scripts.bypass_probe.CASES`, and the repository builder is the probe's
`build`, so the harness that measured the old script and these tests that judge this package cannot
drift apart on what a case is. Only the scanner differs: the probe starts an external script,
these tests call `run_scan` in this process.

Every case runs in `--mode full`, because a scratch repository has no trusted base for `pr` or
`push` mode to resolve. That is the right trust model for a payload regression: the question here
is whether a shape is reported at all, not what a base commit would have allowed.
